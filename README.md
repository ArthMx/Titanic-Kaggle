# Titanic-Kaggle
My submission to the Titanic competition on Kaggle. For this competition, we need to build a model able to predict if a passenger of the Titanic survived his unfortunate journey.

The Titanic notebook contains my EDA, data cleaning and pre-processing steps, as well as my model search.
